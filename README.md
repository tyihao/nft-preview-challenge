## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass compiler
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

Use of HTML semantic tags is important especially for screen readers and also readability of content for other authors.

The use of `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags should be in order of importance.

Place extra importance on CSS properties such as display and position, and also on concepts such as grid and flexbox as they will be particularly important. I struggled to align certain rows like the Ethereum logo and "0.041 ETH".

### Continued development

I also found the hierarchy of HTML and CSS selectors to be quite confusing, and I'm not sure what is the proper way to go about doing it. I would like to make my CSS file to look neater and minimise repeated codes.

### Useful resources
